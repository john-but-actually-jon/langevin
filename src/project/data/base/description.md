The TrialSystem1.28998 files were generated using [SMOG](https://smog-server.org/cgi-bin/GenTopGro.pl).

The following options were chosen

- The supplied pdb file was the [2efv_fixed.pdb](../2efv_fixed.pdb)
- A shadow map contact map was used, as this was compatible with the following option
- C-alpha course graining was used, as is described in the project brief
- The default force field parameters
- Box limits were plus-minus 10 angstroms in every direction
- Periodic boundary conditions **were** used
- Unit mass was used homogeneously across all atoms (this made sense in the context of c-alpha course-graining)
- Charges **were** included
- Errors were not ignored
- Option 10 was left disabled, since course graining was being employed
- Standard output format
- Nickname: `TrialSystem1`
